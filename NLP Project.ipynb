      " Look, Gerry Spence has NOT \"\"never lost a case, criminal or civil.\"\" That is simply untrue. He prevailed in two cases about which he wrote books (Silkwood and the Miss Wyoming vs. Penthouse cases). He won both massively at trial, and both were completely overturned. In 1985 he represented then-15 year old Michael Jones charged with murder as a juvenile. In Oregon the trial was a criminal trial in EVERY sense except that the juvenile neither received a jury (which Spence argued at the time he was entitled to) and the sentencing authority then ended at age 21. Chief Justice Alex Kozinski of the 9Th U.S. Circuit court mentions the arrogance of trial lawyers who claim to \"\"never have lost a cast.\"\"   \"\"n19. There's one famous exception: Gerry Spence, at least to hear him tell it. See Gerry Spence, Gunning for Justice 47 (1982). But see Sherrie F. Nachman, True Lies, Starring Gerry Spence, Am. Law., Sept. 1994, at 13 (disputing Spence's claim made in Gunning for Justice and widely reported by the media, and quoting one victorious Spence adversary, \"\"It's a lie.\"\").\"\"\" \n",

      " ::Use of \"\"assisted suicide\"\" to refer to aid in dying is inaccurate in fourth distinctive ways. First, it was coined by Catholic activists disputing Oregon's Measure 16 in 1994 - so it carries a political bias. Second, the laws in Oregon, Washington and Vermont each do not contain the term \"\"assisted suicide\"\" but use aid in dying. Third, assisting a suicide remains illegal in all three states - and also Montana and New Mexico. No state attorney general or county district attorney has charged any physician or pharmacist who acted within the aid in dying laws of the three states. Finally, describing people who use aid in dying, such as Brittany Maynard, suicides grossly misrepresents their experience and devalues both their lives and deaths. Continued usage of the biased and inaccurate term should be amended throughout Wikipedia.   \" \n",

In fact, you removed the last two and silently changed the other two.  If you want to change text that someone has already responded to, please use  and <\\s>, like this, so it doesn't look like you're being sneaky.  This also looks like you're throwing in every citation you can find without reading or understanding them, hoping something will stick.  If you recall, I asked for one pdf and we're now at numbers 16 and 17 and you're just now learning what the issues are.  And, after taking a look, neither one of your new studies has anything to do with establishing the existence of \"\"energy systems in the body\"\". \n",

      " :::I'm not sure what to say at this point.  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is that you're not reading what you're citing:  you're either cutting and pasting from google or some other source.  Alternatively you're reading all of these papers but have no understanding as to what they contain.  Either way, you might want to consider editing articles that better play to your strengths. \n",

      " :::The first sentence is true, but he neglects to explain why arm-tapping and doll-tapping have equal efficacy.  The second sentence equates talking and tapping with \"\"energy psychology\"\" which has the additional baggage of energy fields that can evidently migrate to arms and dolls.   \n",
      "\n",
      " :::So after 18 citations what we have is the suggestion that a particular kind of talking associated with some sort of physical ritual can be more helpful than other treatments in some situations.  I would be comfortable including the two Feinstein reviews if the shortcomings pointed out in Pignotti are highlighted, and I think Waite (2003) deserves a paragraph.  I don't see an argument for including any of these other citations.  If you want to make such an argument, please be sure to read the citation first and be able to summarize how the citation supports the point you want to make.    \n",

      " 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. \n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after. \n",
